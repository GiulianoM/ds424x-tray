## Hardware Requirements

Minimal hardware required per tray:

* 2 x M5 (5mm) x 0.8 Pitch Socket Head Cap Screws, 60mm long.
  
* 2 x M5x0.8 Nuts - normal or nylon insert lock nuts.

* 4 x 6-32 1/4" Flat Head HDD screws

* 4mm Hex Wrench for the SHCS screws.

* Optional: Superglue

For a full shelf of 24 disks, you will need 48 SHCS screws and 48 nuts, and 96 HDD screws.

I recommend buying from Bolt Depot in packs of 100:

[100 x Metric socket cap, Class 12.9 alloy steel black oxide finish, 5mm x 0.8mm x 65mm](https://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=6532)

[100 x Metric hex nylon insert lock nuts, Zinc plated class 8.8 steel, 5mm x 0.8mm](https://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=4803)

[100 x Machine screws, Phillips flat head, Zinc plated steel, #6-32 x 1/4"](https://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=7601)

## Print Settings

* Material: ABS or PETG. PLA will get soft at HDD temperatures of 45-60C.

* Layer Height: 0.2mm

* Nozzle Size: 0.4mm

* Perimiters: 4

* Infill: 20%, your choice of type.

* Temperatures: I print ABS at 240-235C, with a bed temperature of 110-100C.

* Cooling: I print my ABS inside an enclosure, with cooling fans at 30-50% for all layers except #1.

* Print time: My printer takes about 8 hours to print out a full set for one tray. You will want to have a really, *really* good 1st layer or bed mesh probe, I recommend probing immediately before the print.

## Assembly

1. Insert the 2 x M5 Nuts into the back of the tray halves.

2. If you're using a SATA Interposer board, attach it to the back of the drive.

3. Attach one half of the tray to the HDD using 2x of the 6-32 screws. If you're using the interposer board, fit it into the slots.

4. (Optional) Put some superglue on the edges in the middle of where the two tray sides meet.

5. Attach the other half of the tray, and line up the edges in the middle.

6. Take 2 x M5 SHCS 60mm screws, insert them through the handle and through the front plate, and attach it to the front of the tray. Keep note of the holes on the side for the light pipe channels.

7. Tighten the SHCS screws with the 4mm hex key.
